<p><i><ins>Situation: </ins></i> Our ideal customers are companies or employers that want to provide a
music-listening experience in the workplace, an experience that not only works to boost
company morale, but serves to increase productivity and engagement amongst its employees.
By opening the workplace to music requests, employers must worry about the type of music
being played, the volume of that music, and potentially the selected genre of that music given
the different types of work environments.

<i><ins>Target: </ins></i> Our customer objective is to deliver a product that is intuitive and hassle-free, for both
employers and employees, in order to provide a seamless listening experience, an experience that
requires little to no work to maintain, and works to benefit the workplace and everyone in it.</p>
